Version "current"
 - Load / store does not throw checked exceptions anymore (wrapped inside a CfgException)
 - getSubsetName() returns a more readable name (without the . at the end)
 - toMap() method automatically resolves values if the Cfg instance is a subset, as otherwise value might be not resolvable anymore
